# ðŸš€ Getting started with Strapi Media Folders 

With the release of Strapi [v4.20](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v4.2.0) and [v4.3.0-beta.1](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v4.3.0-beta.1), I created this repo to test the released features. 

### `Project description` 
This is an application that is used to store TV show characters, from categories like `Sci-fi`, `Anime`,`Animation`, etc. In this application, we used Media folders to help us manage the assets of the characters from the shows, as well as posters for the show.
